# CharacterCraft

CharacterCraft is a web application that allows users to generate unique and detailed characters for their stories, role-playing games, or any other creative project. Using OpenAI's API, CharacterCraft generates a wide range of character attributes such as gender, age, occupation, physical appearance, and more.

## Features

* Character generation: Users can generate a character by filling out a simple form with the desired attributes. If left blank, the attributes will be generated by OpenAI's API.
* Character storage: Each generated character is given a unique ID and stored on the server, allowing users to access and view characters at any time.
* Character viewing: Users can view generated characters in detail, including all attributes and a detailed description. 

## Technology
CharacterCraft is built using the Flask web framework for Python. It uses OpenAI's API for character generation and SQLite for character storage. The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Developments
* Character editing: Users will be able to edit their generated characters.
* Character sharing: Users will be able to share their generated characters with other users.
* Character searching: Users will be able to search for specific generated characters.



CharacterCraft is a powerful tool for any creative project and is constantly being updated and improved to better serve its users. Whether you're an author, game master, or just looking for inspiration, CharacterCraft is the perfect tool for generating unique and detailed characters.
